# OOPs Java
OOPs is stand for Object-Oriented Programming. OOP makes programs faster, more structured, easier to maintain, and reusable, reducing redundancy and development time.


## Key Concepts

- Class
- Object


## Documentation

- A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
- It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

Example: Think of a skeleton as a class. The object is the actual human body, which is an instance of that skeleton blueprint. Just like how every individual human body (object) has features based on the skeleton (class), every object created from a class will have its own specific attributes but follow the same structure defined by the class.



## Class Attributes and Methods

- Class attributes are like variables that represent the state of an object. These attributes are defined inside the class and can be accessed or modified by methods within the class.

- class methods are functions that are declared inside the class and define the behavior of the objects created from that class.



## Four Pillars of OOP
There are four main Pillars in OOP.
1. Encapsulation:-  It hides unnecessary data (protecting it from unauthorized access) in the form of a capsule and shows only the necessary information to the user.
2. Inheritance:- The child takes data from the parent class or we can say the child class inherits data and behavior from the parent class.
3. Abstraction:- It is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
4. Polymorphism (Poly:-Many and morphism:- behaviour):- It means there is something which behaves differently in different different situation based on requirements.
